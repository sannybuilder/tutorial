description: Write your first CLEO script to display a message in GTA San Andreas
slug: script-show-message
---

Let's write our first script. We already know all the necessary elements to get started.

Create a new CLEO script file by clicking `File` -> `New CLEO Script...`.

<img src="/img/ch-01-07-1.png" alt="New CLEO script menu" width="400" />

After `nop` add a new line:

```sb
print_string_now "Hello, world!" 2000
```

Your script should look like this:

```sb
{$CLEO .cs}
nop

print_string_now "Hello, world!" 2000

terminate_this_script
```

Save the file under any name, e.g. `show_message.txt`. Click `Run` -> `Compile + Copy` or press `F7` to compile the script and copy it to the game folder.

<img src="/img/ch-01-07-2.png" alt="Compile+Copy menu" width="400" />

If it did not work, set the path to the game folder in the settings `F10`.

<img src="/img/ch-01-07-3.png" alt="Game Directory setting" width="200" />

Now click `Run` -> `Run San Andreas` or press `F8` to run the game.

Start a new game or load a save. You should see a message:

<img src="/img/ch-01-07-4.png" alt="Hello, world!" width="400" />

Congratulations! If you are curious to know what `2000` means in `print_string_now`, check the [documentation](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/sa/CLEO/0ACD). It controls how long the message is displayed. The value is in milliseconds. Try changing it to `20000` and see what happens.

_If you don't see the text, check the CLEO folder in the game directory. It should contain the compiled script file with the same name as the source file (e.g. `show_message.cs`). If it is there but the message is still not showing, check the CLEO log file (`.cleo.log`) in the CLEO folder. It may contain error messages._

**What's next?**

Try these modifications and recompile:

- Change the message text to something else.
- Try using `print_big_string` instead of `print_string_now`. Note that it has an extra third parameter, which is the style of the text. You will learn more about it in the [next chapter](/basic-messages). For now, you can just set it to `1` to see the difference.
