<Quiz questions={[
	{
		question: "Why must you include a wait command inside a loop?",
		answers: [
			"It makes the loop run faster",
			"It prevents the game from freezing by giving it time to process other things",
			"The loop won't compile without it",
			"It counts the number of iterations"
		],
		correct: 1,
		hint: "The game is single-threaded. If a script runs continuously without pausing, nothing else gets a chance to run."
	},
	{
		question: "What does wait 0 do?",
		answers: [
			"It does nothing and is ignored",
			"It waits for exactly zero seconds (no effect)",
			"It pauses the script for one game frame",
			"It crashes the script"
		],
		correct: 2,
		hint: "Even a wait of 0 milliseconds has a special meaning — it still yields control."
	},
	{
		question: "In a while true loop, how do you exit the loop?",
		answers: [
			"The loop exits automatically if it runs for too long",
			"Use the break command",
			"Use the continue command to exit the loop and continue executing the script",
			"You can't — it runs indefinitely"
		],
		correct: 1,
		hint: "There is a specific command designed to exit a loop early."
	},
	{
		question: "True or false: You must put wait at the start of every code block.",
		answers: [
			"True",
			"False"
		],
		correct: 1,
		hint: "You only need it while waiting on game or player conditions."
