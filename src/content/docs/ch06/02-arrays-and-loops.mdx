Arrays become truly powerful when combined with loops. Instead of writing the same operation for each element by hand, a `for` loop can process the entire array in just a few lines.

## Initializing an Array

If you needed to set all elements to the same value — say, zero — use a `for` loop:

```sb
int scores[10]
int i

for i = 0 to 9
    scores[i] = 0
end
```

The loop variable `i` goes from `0` to `9`, covering every valid index in a 10-element array.

## Iterating Over an Array

Reading from an array follows the same pattern. This snippet prints all five weapon IDs on screen, one per second:

```sb
int weapons[5]

weapons[0] = 346
weapons[1] = 347
weapons[2] = 352
weapons[3] = 355
weapons[4] = 356

int i
for i = 0 to 4
    print_formatted_now "Weapons[%d] = %d" 1000 i weapons[i]
    wait 1000
end
```

## Searching an Array

A common task is to find a specific value in an array. Loop through the elements and check each one:

```sb
int weapons[5]

weapons[0] = 346
weapons[1] = 347
weapons[2] = 352
weapons[3] = 355
weapons[4] = 356

int i
for i = 0 to 4
    if weapons[i] == 352 // UZI
    then
        print_formatted_now "UZI found at index %d" 2000 i
        break
    end
end
```

The `break` exits the loop as soon as the UZI is found — no need to keep checking the rest.

:::tip
When working with arrays, always make sure the index stays within bounds. Accessing an element outside the valid range (e.g. index `5` in a 5-element array) leads to unpredictable behavior.
