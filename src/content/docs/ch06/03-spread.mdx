title: Spread Operator
description: Passing array elements to commands with the spread operator

Many game commands expect multiple separate values. For example, creating a vehicle needs three coordinate values — X, Y, and Z:

```sb
Car vehicle = create_car 415 {at} 2488.56 -1660.16 13.34
```

If those coordinates are stored in an array, you'd normally have to write each element out:

```sb
float pos[3]

pos[0] = 2488.56
pos[1] = -1660.16
pos[2] = 13.34

Car vehicle = create_car 415 {at} pos[0] pos[1] pos[2]
```

This works, but it's verbose. The _spread operator_ (`...`) offers a shorthand. Prefixing an array name with `...` expands all its elements in place:

```sb
float pos[3]

pos[0] = 2488.56
pos[1] = -1660.16
pos[2] = 13.34

Car vehicle = create_car 415 {at} ...pos
```

The compiler replaces `...pos` with `pos[0] pos[1] pos[2]` during compilation. The result is identical to writing the elements out manually.

## Reading Into an Array

The spread operator works on the receiving side too. When a command outputs multiple values, you can capture them directly into an array:

```sb
float pos[3]

...pos = get_char_coordinates $scplayer
```

This is equivalent to:

```sb
pos[0], pos[1], pos[2] = get_char_coordinates $scplayer 
```

All three coordinates are stored in the array in one line.

:::tip
You can combine the spread operation with other variables, and even other spread arrays. For example:

```sb
int leftStick[2]
int rightStick[2]

...leftStick, ...rightStick = get_position_of_analogue_sticks 0
```

## Practical Example

Combining both directions, here's a pattern you'll see often — read the player's position, then use it to create something nearby:

```sb
float pos[3]

...pos = get_char_coordinates $scplayer
pos[0] += 5.0 // add offset to X

Car vehicle = create_car 415 {at} ...pos
```

This reads the player's X, Y, Z into the array, shifts the X coordinate, and spawns a vehicle at the adjusted position.

:::note
The spread operator expands _all_ elements of the array. You can't spread just a subset — it's always the entire array.
