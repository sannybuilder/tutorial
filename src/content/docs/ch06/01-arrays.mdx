So far, every variable we've used stores a single value. That works fine when you need one vehicle or one counter, but what if you need to store ten coordinates, or five weapon IDs? Declaring `x1`, `x2`, `x3`... `x10` gets tedious fast.

An _array_ solves this. It is a collection of elements of the same type, stored under a single name. Each element is accessed by its _index_ — a number starting from `0`.

## Declaring an Array

To declare an array, write the type followed by the name and the number of elements in square brackets:

```sb
int scores[5]
```

This creates an array called `scores` with 5 integer elements. You can do the same with other types:

```sb
float pos[3]
string names[3]
longstring descriptions[3]
```

## Reading and Writing Elements

To access an element, use square brackets with the index:

```sb
longstring names[3]

names[0] = "Infernus"
names[1] = "Cheetah"
names[2] = "Banshee"
```

Remember, indexing starts at `0`. An array of 3 elements has valid indices `0` through `2`.

You can use a variable as the index:

```sb
longstring names[3]

int i = 2
names[i] = "Banshee"

```

After this, the third element (index `2`) holds the value `"Banshee"`.

Array elements work just like regular variables. You can use them in conditions, arithmetic, and commands:

```sb
int scores[3]

scores[0] = 50
scores[1] = scores[0] + 10
scores[0] += 100

if scores[0] > scores[1]
then
    print_formatted_now "First is bigger: %d" 2000 scores[0]
end
```

:::tip
Use arrays whenever you have a group of related values of the same type. If you find yourself naming variables `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, that's a sign you need an array.
