## Native Formatting

The game allows the use of special tokens to highlight different parts of text. They usually appear like a specific character surrounded by `~`, e.g. `~b~` or `~y~`. [This page](https://gtamods.com/wiki/GXT#Symbols_and_colors) describes each token in detail.

For example, the GXT key `STOCK` references the message `~r~out of stock` (`~r~` means red), which in the game looks like this:

```sb
PRINT_HELP {key} 'STOCK'
```

Some messages include placeholders for numbers, represented as ~1~. Regardless of their position and total number of placeholders, the token is always ~1~.

For example, the message displayed when you pick up a horseshoe is `Horseshoes ~1~ out of ~1~`, referenced by the key HO_ONE. To display it in the game, use one of the commands that include `WITH_NUMBER` in it. For two numbers, for example, use `PRINT_WITH_2_NUMBERS_NOW` or `PRINT_WITH_2_NUMBERS_BIG`:

```sb
PRINT_WITH_2_NUMBERS_BIG {key} 'HO_ONE' {num1} 5 {num2} 50 {duration} 3000 {style} 1
```

## CLEO Formatting

CLEO supports C++-like inline formatting with placeholders that can be replaced with actual values at runtime. The syntax is similar to C++'s `printf` function. These commands have [`FORMATTED`](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/sa/script?q=print%20formatted) in their name. For example, the following command would display the same message as above.

```sb
PRINT_BIG_FORMATTED  {format} "Horseshoes %d out of %d" {time} 3000 {style} 1 {args} 5 50
```

You can combine native and CLEO formatting for richer visual effects:

```sb
PRINT_BIG_FORMATTED  {format} "~r~Horseshoes %d out of %d" {time} 3000 {style} 1 {args} 5 50
```
