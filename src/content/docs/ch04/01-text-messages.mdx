Text messages play an important role in many scripts. They can appear as part of the user interface, for example, in menus, or serve as subtitles, gameplay instructions, or debugging information.

The game provides several built-in methods for displaying text on screen:

- [Help box](/basic-messages#help-boxes) – a small black rectangle in the top-left corner, often used to provide contextual help

- [Mission text](/basic-messages#mission-text) – large, centered, or bottom-screen text, typically used for mission objectives or subtitles.

- [Text Draw](/text-draws) – short text elements displayed at specific coordinates, commonly used for showing information such as player position or debug values.

CLEO 5 introduces an additional display type: the yellow [trace message](/debug-messages), shown on the left side of the screen. It is especially useful for debugging and logging script behavior.

Most text messages remain visible for a fixed duration — from a single frame to several seconds — though they can also be shown repeatedly in a loop to stay visible longer.
