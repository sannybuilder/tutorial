## Help Boxes

In the base game, text commands require a GXT key - an 8-character string referencing one of the predefined text entries in the active GXT file (for example, `american.gxt` when the game language is set to English).

For example, to display a help box with the text 'San Andreas', you need to use the command `PRINT_HELP` with the key `'SAN_AND'`:

```sb
PRINT_HELP {key} 'SAN_AND'
```

How one could find what key refers to what text? There is an online tool
that lets you navigate all standard game messages and their keys:
https://public.sannybuilder.com/GXT/search/?game=SA%20PC. It supports all
available languages and can work with user-provided GXT files.

Sometimes you need custom text that doesn’t exist in the original GXT files. There are two easy ways to do this:

1. CLEO supports custom text dictionary format called `FXT`, which allows you to define new keys and messages without having to edit GXT files. FXT files are loaded automatically from the `CLEO_TEXT` folder.

Each FXT file contains a list of plain text entries in the following format:

```
<KEY> <TEXT>
```

2. Use CLEO commands that accept strings directly, without using a GXT key. For example, to display the same help box use:

```sb
PRINT_HELP_STRING {text} "San Andreas"
```

Notice that because the text is longer than 8 characters, you need to use double quotes.

## Mission Text
