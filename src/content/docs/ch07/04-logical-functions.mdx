In [Chapter III](/conditions), we learned that conditions are special commands that set a true/false result for the current `if` statement. What if your own function could do the same? That's exactly what the `logical` return type enables.

## Functions as Conditions

Declare a function with the `logical` return type to use it as a condition:

```sb
function isPlayerRich(): logical
    int money = store_score {player} 0
    return money > 1000000
end
```

The `return` statement takes a condition expression. The result — true or false — is passed back to the caller. Now you can use this function directly in an `if` statement:

```sb
if isPlayerRich()
then
    print_string_now "Living the dream!" 2000
else
    print_string_now "Keep grinding." 2000
end
```

## Returning True or False

Instead of a condition expression, you can return `true` or `false` explicitly:

```sb
function isValidLevel(level: int): logical
    if or
        level < 0
        level > 6
    then
        return false
    end
    return true
end
```

This is useful when the logic has multiple branches or when you want the intent to be extra clear.

## Combining with Other Conditions

A logical function can be mixed with other conditions in `if and` or `if or`, just like any built-in condition:

```sb
if and
    isValidLevel(wantedLevel)
    is_player_playing 0
then
    set_max_wanted_level wantedLevel
end
```

:::tip
A `logical` function answers a yes/no question. It doesn't produce a value — it sets the condition result for the current `if` statement.
