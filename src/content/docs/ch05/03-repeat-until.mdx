title: REPEAT..UNTIL Loop
description: A loop that always executes at least once
slug: repeat-until
---

The `while` loop checks its condition _before_ each iteration. If the condition is false from the start, the body never runs at all. Sometimes that's not what you want -- you need the body to execute at least once, and only then decide whether to keep going.

The `repeat..until` loop does exactly that. It runs the body first, then checks the condition. If the condition is true, the loop stops. If it's false, the loop repeats.

## Syntax

```sb
repeat
    <body>
until <condition>
```

Compare this with `while`:

| | Checks condition | Guaranteed to run at least once? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `while` | Before each iteration | No |
| `repeat..until` | After each iteration | Yes |

## Example

Here is a simple `repeat..until` loop that waits for the player to press `F5`:

```sb
repeat
    wait 0
until is_key_pressed 116
```

The `wait 0` always executes at least once, giving the game a chance to process input before the first check. Compare it with the equivalent `while` version:

```sb
while not is_key_pressed 116
    wait 0
end
```

Both achieve the same result, but notice how the condition is inverted: `while` needs `not is_key_pressed` (keep going while the key is _not_ pressed), whereas `repeat..until` uses `is_key_pressed` directly (stop when the key _is_ pressed).

## Practical Example

This script counts how many seconds the player waits before pressing `F5`:

```sb
int seconds = 0

repeat
    wait 1000
    seconds += 1
    print_formatted_now "Waiting... %d seconds" 1000 seconds
until is_key_pressed 116

print_formatted_now "You waited %d seconds!" 3000 seconds
```

Because `repeat..until` always runs the body first, the counter starts at `1` even if the player presses `F5` immediately.

:::tip
Use `repeat..until` when you need the loop body to execute at least once -- for example, displaying a prompt before checking the player's response. Use `while` when the body should be skipped entirely if the condition is already false.
