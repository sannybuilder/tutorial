description: Write a CLEO script that gives the player money in a countdown loop

Let's put this chapter's concepts together. We will write a script that waits for a key press, then gives the player a cash bonus over several rounds with a countdown.

The final script will look like this:

```sb
{$CLEO .cs}
nop

const ROUNDS = 5
const BONUS = 250
const KEY_START = 116 // F5
const KEY_STOP = 117  // F6

// wait for F5 to start
while not is_key_pressed KEY_START
    wait 0
end

int i
for i = ROUNDS downto 1
    // exit early if F6 is pressed
    if is_key_pressed KEY_STOP
    then
        break
    end

    add_score 0 BONUS
    print_formatted_now "+$%d (%d rounds left)" 1000 BONUS i
    wait 1000
end

print_string_now "All done!" 2000

terminate_this_script
```

Let's walk through it.

The first section declares constants for all configurable values. Changing `ROUNDS` or `BONUS` at the top adjusts the entire script behavior without touching the rest of the code:

```sb
const ROUNDS = 5
const BONUS = 250
const KEY_START = 116 // F5
const KEY_STOP = 117  // F6
```

Next, the script waits for the player to press `F5`. This is the same pattern used in the [vehicle spawning script](/script-spawn-vehicle):

```sb
while not is_key_pressed KEY_START
    wait 0
end
```

The main body is a `for` loop counting down from `ROUNDS` to `1`. On each iteration, it adds money to the player's account and displays a formatted message showing the bonus amount and remaining rounds:

```sb
int i
for i = ROUNDS downto 1
    ...
    add_score 0 BONUS
    print_formatted_now "+$%d (%d rounds left)" 1000 BONUS i
    wait 1000
end
```

Inside the loop, a `break` condition checks if `F6` is pressed. If so, the loop exits early:

```sb
    if is_key_pressed KEY_STOP
    then
        break
    end
```

Save the file as `bonus_counter.txt` and press `F7` to compile and copy. Start a new game (or load a save), press `F5`, and watch the bonuses roll in. Press `F6` at any time to stop early.

**What's next?**

Try these modifications and recompile:

- Change `ROUNDS` to `10` and `BONUS` to `100`.
- Replace `downto` with `to` so the counter goes up instead of down.
- Add `step 2` to give a bonus every other round.
- Instead of `break`, try using `continue` to skip a specific round (e.g. skip round 3).
