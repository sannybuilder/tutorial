In this tutorial we will be using the most recent versions Sanny Builder and CLEO Library. At the time of writing, it's Sanny Builder 4.0.0 and CLEO 5.0.0-alpha.32. Follow these steps to install or update them:

*1.* Download Sanny Builder's installer from the [official website](https://sannybuilder.com).

*Some browsers may warn you that the file is not commonly downloaded and may be dangerous. This is a false positive. You can safely ignore this warning. If your local antivirus software prevents you from downloading or running Sanny Builder, consider adding it to the list of exceptions.*

*2.* Run the installer and follow its instructions. You need to select a folder where Sanny Builder will be installed. The default folder is `C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Sanny Builder 4.0.0`, but you can choose a different one.

*It's not recommended to install Sanny Builder in a folder that requires administrator privileges to access (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)`). If you do, you will have to run Sanny Builder as an administrator.*

*3.* Once the installation is complete, go to the folder where you installed Sanny Builder. Find a directory `tools\CLEO5` and open it.

*4.* Copy all files from this directory to the folder where you installed GTA San Andreas. The default folder is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas`. If you installed the game in a different folder, copy the files there.

*5.* Run Sanny Builder (`sanny.exe`). You should see a window like this:

*6.* Click `Tools` in the menu bar and select `Options...`. A window with Sanny Builder settings will open. Click `...` button next to `GTA SA Directory` and select the folder where you installed GTA San Andreas.

Click `OK` to save the settings. The word CLEO in the bottom right corner of the window should turn green. If it doesn't, you didn't copy CLEO files correctly, or you selected the wrong folder in the settings.

*7.* Try to run the game from Sanny Builder. Click `Run` in the menu bar and select `Run San Andreas`. If everything is set up correctly, the game should start. If it doesn't, check the settings and try again. Check if the game menu displays a CLEO version in the bottom left corner.
