Another type of parameter is a string. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. We will learn the difference between single and double quotes later:

```cs
print_help 'GXT_KEY'
load_sprite 1 "DOWN"
```

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the term _literal_ to refer to number and string constants hardcoded in the source code. `12`, `30`, `0.5` are number literals. `GXT_KEY`, `DOWN` are string literals.
